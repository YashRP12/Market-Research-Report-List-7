<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lime Plaster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrated Lime</li><li>Non-Hydraulic Lime</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lime plaster market is primarily divided into two types: hydrated lime and non-hydraulic lime. Hydrated lime, produced by adding water to quicklime, offers properties such as durability and workability, making it suitable for various construction applications. Non-hydraulic lime, on the other hand, derives its strength from carbonation and is often used in historical restoration and traditional masonry due to its breathability and low shrinkage. Both types are essential for enhancing moisture control and aesthetic appeal in building projects.</p></p>
