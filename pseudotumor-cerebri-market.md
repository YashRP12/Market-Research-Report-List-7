<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pseudotumor Cerebri Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fundoscopy</li><li>Neuroimaging</li><li>Lumbar Puncture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pseudotumor Cerebri market comprises three primary diagnostic types: fundoscopy, neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture. Fundoscopy involves examining the retina to detect optic nerve swelling, a common sign of increased intracranial pressure. Neuroimaging, including MRI and CT scans, visualizes brain structures to assess possible causes of symptoms. Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, measures cerebrospinal fluid pressure and can provide diagnostic clarity by ruling out other conditions. Together, these methods aid in the timely diagnosis and management of pseudotumor cerebri.</p></p>
