<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Speciality Optical Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Single-mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specialty optical fibers market is primarily divided into two types: multimode fiber and single-mode fiber. Multimode fiber features a larger core diameter, allowing multiple light modes to travel simultaneously, which is ideal for short-distance data transmission and applications like local area networks. In contrast, single-mode fiber has a smaller core, permitting only one light mode, enabling longer-distance communication with higher bandwidth and reduced signal loss, making it suitable for telecommunications and high-speed data transfer applications.</p></p>
